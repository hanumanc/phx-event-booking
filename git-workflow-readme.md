### Branch Types

1. **`main`** (Protected)
   - Production-ready code only
   - No direct commits allowed
   - Only receives merges from release branches after testing
   - Tagged with version numbers for releases

2. **`release/*`**
   - Active development branch
   - Integration point for all features
   - Format: `release/X.Y.Z` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`)
   - All feature branches merge here

3. **`feature/*`**
   - Individual feature development
   - Created from the current release branch
   - Format: `feature/issue-description` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
   - Deleted after merging to release

4. **`hotfix/*`**
   - Emergency fixes for production
   - Created from `main`
   - Merged to both `main` and current `release` branch

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/hanumanc/phx-event-booking
cd phx-event-booking
```

### 2. Setup Git Configuration

```bash
# Set your user information
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@company.com"

# Set up useful aliases
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

### 3. Fetch All Branches

```bash
git fetch --all
git branch -a  # List all branches
```

## ðŸ’» Feature Development

### Step 1: Create Feature Branch

Always create your feature branch from the current release branch:

```bash
# Ensure you have the latest release branch
git checkout release/1.0.0
git pull origin release/1.0.0

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Example for each developer:
# Developer 1
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Develo
